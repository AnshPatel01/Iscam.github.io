      <div class="para">
        <p>
          FitTrack empowers individuals to achieve their unique fitness and
          nutrition goals through a simple, adaptable exercise and weight
          management tool, helping to create healthier lifestyles for all. In
          today’s busy world where time is a premium, FitTrack aims to quickly
          and effectively serve health-conscious users and consolidate their
          needs into one system.
        </p>
        <p>
          FitTrack is designed for health-driven individuals who prioritize
          managing their fitness and nutrition effectively but need a
          convenient, all-in-one solution to fit into their busy lifestyles. The
          target audience includes people with a range of fitness goals—whether
          they are beginners looking to lose weight, fitness enthusiasts aiming
          to maintain their progress, or athletes striving to optimize their
          performance. These users value simplicity, personalization, and
          flexibility in a system that adapts to their goals and preferences.
          FitTrack appeals to those who seek a reliable, seamless tool to
          streamline their health management without the need to juggle multiple
          applications or complicated interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can set personalized fitness goals—whether it’s gaining,
          maintaining, or losing weight—and receive actionable guidelines to
          help achieve them. With the ability to modify their goals at any time
          and set custom time frames, FitTrack seamlessly adjusts to the evolving
          needs and lifestyles of its users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system generates personalized exercise plans based on the user’s
          fitness goals, complemented by meal suggestions tailored to their
          recommended daily calorie intake. These suggestions include preset
          meals with detailed macronutrient information, offering users a quick
          and easy way to plan their nutrition. Additionally, users can add their
          own recipes to the system, enabling them to track and manage their
          unique dietary preferences. This combination of customization and
          guidance ensures that FitTrack supports a wide range of lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of FitTrack lies in its ability to simplify and centralize
          fitness and nutrition management into one comprehensive tool. By
          combining exercise tracking, personalized meal plans, and flexible
          goal-setting in a single platform, FitTrack eliminates the need for
          multiple apps, saving users time and effort. Additionally, it will be
          easy to use, making it accessible to individuals at all fitness levels,
          encouraging consistent use and long-term success.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success of FitTrack will be measured by several key indicators.
          First, we aim to gather positive feedback from 90% of active users
          within six months of using the system, where an active user is someone
          who signs into the system on four unique days in any week. Additionally,
          through simple surveys, we expect at least 50% of active users to report
          achieving measurable progress towards their health and fitness goals,
          where they will be asked questions regarding their physical performance,
          weight changes, or overall well-being, demonstrating the system’s
          effectiveness and user satisfaction.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The refactoring and debugging after iteration 2 allowed us to have a ready product for iteration 3. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The strategy for avoiding merge conflics worked well after the first iteration. With us preventing any merge conflicts later on.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commit reviews after each developer task finished, and manually checking the changes allowed preventing any new bugs and SOLID violations. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Full separation of concerns between Food/Exercise/User streams and individual work on each of them allowed a smooth development process and a good workflow.

        <h3 class="list-heading">What Went Wrong</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At early interations we did not propely undertand the requirements of the project, as well as how to use the tools provided. 
          </li>
          <li>
            For first two iterations we just trusted that the code that others write is good as is, and did not review it. This caused a lot of bugs later on. 
          </li>
          <li>
            There was not quite enough information on how to use the tools provided, and we had to learn a lot of things on our own, usually by trial and error. 
          </li>
          <li>
            We did not ask for the intermediate steps to be shown allowing mutiple feature to not be developed at all.
          </li>
          <li>
            We had interdeveloper dependencies i.e. more than one developer working on the same User/Food/Exercise stream, slowing down the development process.

              In our i2 what we should improve we mentioned assining specific project streams User/Food/Exercise to each
              developer, rather than layers. And indeed it was a good idea as each person could eaiser understand their stream 
              and how to work with it, allowing for smooth development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another thing we mentioned was having more common meetings and code collaboratively. We did not do that, on the contrary
              we did not have any meetings at all, and surprisingly it worked out extremely well. We were able to work on our own and
              not be distracted by other developers.

              The actual returned product is incredbly different from the initial vision. The initial vision was to
              have a proper calorie planner with ability to plan daily calorie difference and have a proper meal and exercise plan.
              However, we ended up with a simple calorie counter with no ability to plan anything, due to the incredible complexity of a planner.
              This project however, can be used as a base for a calorie planner, and we can build on top of it.
